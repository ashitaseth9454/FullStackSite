        So this is me, <acronym title="I don't know the meaning of my name yet">Ashita Vijay Seth</acronym>, a <em>student</em> at GLA University.  I realized my passion for art when I was 9 yr old; currently, I am working under a startup (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/merchantsaheb/?hl=en">Merchant Saheb</a>) as a Head of design and marketing. I have my doodle page, which I just started during this period of lockdown         <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashita.doodles/?hl=en"><em>(@ashita.doodles )</em></a>. I forgot to tell you that I also believe in self-promotion. So, in short, you'll find scribbling my notebook (sometimes even the desks and walls of my university) </b></p><br>
